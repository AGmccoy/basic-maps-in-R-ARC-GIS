Investigation Title	RNA sequencing of the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus with the new antifungal drug 089 -SYBARIS					
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA sequencing of the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus with the new antifungal drug 089 -SYBARIS
Experiment Description	The mechanism of action of the new antifungal compound 089 was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The compound had antifungal effects also on pathogenic fungi.  While on Candida species the treatment induced cells death, on A. fumigatus strains it inhibited the conidia transition to hyphae. We carried out RNA sequencing analysis to evaluate at the molecular level the effect of the treatment on Aspergillus.

Protocol Description	A. fumigatus conidia were collected from solid Saboraud cultures using PBS+0.1% Tween, avoiding mycelium fragment and hyphae collection.  Conidia were then inoculated in RPMI 1640 medium + 2% glucose at 2.5x105 conidia/ml concentration supplemented with either 0.1mM 089 molecule or an equal volume of DMSO.  Cells were grown for 4 hours in static at 37C.	After 4 hours of growth in static at 37C, RNA was extracted from flash frozen samples by bead beating with Trizol.	For each sample, one paired-end mRNA library with approximately 150bp insert size was prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina).	Libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 lanes using 2x75 bp reads. The cluster generation kit was TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS, and the sequencing kit was TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS. More than 40 million reads were generated for each sample.	 Alignment has been done by using tophat2 with the Aspergillus fumigatus A1160 reference genome sequence and annotation files downloaded from NCBI (download date: 4 Nov 2016). 	Raw reads were filtered and trimmed by using the IlluQC and TrimmingReads tools of the NGS QC Toolkit package, respectively. The filtering process was carried out with the default options. The trimming was carried out with mild thresholds, namely -q 5 -n 25.
